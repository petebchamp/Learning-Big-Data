# Learning-Big-Data

Starting in summer 2019 I began learning big data after working primarily with non-big data and traditional relational data for many, many years. I started a Big Data Technologies certificate program through the University of Washington in October, 2019 (and completed it in June 2020), but for a few months prior to that I tried to learn as much on my own as possible. I focused on skills that I thought I needed to improve and important technologies that I thought I may not get a chance to learn through the certificate program (where many assignments were completed in Spark through Azure Databricks).

Below are some of the courses I worked through in the summer and early fall of 2019:

* The Unix Workbench 	https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix/home/welcome

Additionally, I've completed lots of Python courses on DataCamp and several Azure and AWS tutorials on Pluralsight. I am trying to prepare for two Azure Data Engineer exams.
